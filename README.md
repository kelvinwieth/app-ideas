# App Ideas
This is a fork from https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas, where I simply remove some unnecessary files, rename and organize others, in order to focus on implementations, and have a structure like this:
```
📁 projects  
 └── 📁 1-beginner  
     └── 📁 bin2dec_app  
         ├── 📄 bin2dec_app.md  
         └── 📁 implementations  
             ├── 📁 android  
             ├── 📁 flutter  
             ├── 📁 csharp  
             └── 📁 whatever_language_or_framework_you_want  
```
